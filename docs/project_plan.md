# Elevator Pitch

- We are looking at diabetes data from 2015 with 21 different features to see how well it predicts diabetes
- We will look and see if the data is imbalanced; and see how different balancing methods work 
- We will also look at the dataset that has prediabetes and see if prediabetes can also be predicted from the features
- **Bonus** if time allows we will look at original source CDC data for different years and see if we can repeat that analysis
