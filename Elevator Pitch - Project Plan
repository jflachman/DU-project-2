Elevator Pitch
•	We are looking at diabetes data from 2015 with 21 different features to see how well it predicts diabetes
•	We will look and see if the data is imbalanced; and see how different balancing methods work 
•	We will also look at the dataset that has prediabetes and see if prediabetes can also be predicted from the features
•	** if time allows we will look at original source CDC data for different years and see if we can repeat that analysis** (bonus)

Agile processes to build out project ideation & planning: 
•	Project ideation – due by: 05/30/24
