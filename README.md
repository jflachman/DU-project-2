## Project Overview

The Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset contains healthcare statistics and lifestyle survey information about people and their diabetes diagnosis. It includes 35 features, such as demographics, lab test results, and answers to survey questions for each patient. The target variable for classification indicates whether a patient has diabetes, is pre-diabetic, or is healthy.
### Executive Summary


### Selected Dataset

The selected dataset is the 2021 CDC dataset.
We have concentrated our efforts on the following risk factors for diabetes.

***Risk Factors***
 There are many risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes, including:

${\color{green}Age}$ Being over 40 increases your risk.    

${\color{green}Family history}$ A parent, sibling, or other relative with type 1 or 2 diabetes increases your risk.

${\color{green}Ethnicity}$People of certain races and ethnicities, including African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, and Asian Americans, are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.

${\color{green}Inactivity}$ The less active you are, the greater your risk.

${\color{green}Weight}$ Being overweight or obese increases your risk. You can estimate your risk by measuring your waist circumference. Men have a higher risk if their waist circumference is more than 40 inches, while women who are not pregnant have a higher risk if their waist circumference is more than 35 inches.

${\color{green}Blood pressure}$ High blood pressure can lead to insulin resistance and eventually type 2 diabetes.

${\color{green}Cholesterol$ High cholesterol can raise your risk for diabetes and heart disease.

${\color{green}Smoking}$ Smokers are 30-40% more likely than non-smokers to develop type 2 diabetes.

***Indicators***
Diabetes is a chronic condition that can be diagnosed by a medical professional. While it often has no symptoms, some indicators include:

${\color{green}Urination}$ Frequent urination, especially at night
${\color{green}Thirst}$ Excessive thirst
${\color{green}Hunger}$ Increased hunger, even when eating
${\color{green}Weight loss}$ Unintentional weight loss
${\color{green}Fatigue}$ Feeling more tired than usual
${\color{green}Vision}$ Blurred vision
${\color{green}Wounds}$ Cuts and bruises that take longer to heal
${\color{green}Skin}$ Itchy skin or genital itching
${\color{green}Infections}$ Urinary tract infections (UTIs) or yeast infections
${\color{green}Sensations}$ Unusual sensations like tingling, burning, or prickling
